# Scrape LDraw library and add parts into a excel list

Inspired by https://brickarchitect.com/labels/ , I wanted something similar.

My script let's you input a Lego-Part-no. searches it in the LDRAW Library and stores gathered information into a excel file.
It has some Error Handling. You have to type exit to save the file properly!

I use Label LIVE in combination with a Brother QL-700 thermal printer.
Check out the example pdf and if you want the layout file!

Installation:

1. Install necessary packages with

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. run main.py
